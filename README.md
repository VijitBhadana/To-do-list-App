To-Do List App with Alarm & Task Tracking
I have developed a To-Do List App using React that helps users efficiently manage their tasks with built-in alert functionalities. The app ensures you never miss a deadline by displaying a pop-up alert whenever a task is about to reach its deadline.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Task Management â€“ Add, edit, and delete tasks easily.
âœ… Deadline Alerts â€“ Get pop-up reminders when a task's deadline is near.
âœ… Completion Tracking â€“ View the number of completed and pending tasks.
âœ… Progress Insights â€“ Monitor your task completion rate in real time.

This app provides a simple yet powerful way to stay organized and on top of your daily tasks! ðŸš€
